# *TESTS*




This directory contains tests that demonstrate the *Stateshaper* engine compared to other popular algorithms. 

The main categories being tested are:

    Determinism
    Reversibility
    Personalization
    Compression

In relevant areas, *Stateshaper* outperforms existing algorithms such as *Markov Chain*, *Cellular Automata*, *Pseudo-Random Number Generation* and *Probalistic Methods*. It is also an advanced tool for *Machine Learning (ML) Training* and *Procedural Generation*.

**CURRENT TESTS**


***Markov Chain***

Uses an NPC behavior model to demostrate how *Stateshaper* can derive predictable actions from statsitcs. The output is created from memory, reproducible and reverisible. It is also **compressed** and obfuscated for privacy. Markov can do this based on probability, but the output is random rather than determined.

There may be instances where Markov chain is preferred, but the highlight is that *Stateshaper* can do all Markov can and additionally add compression and obfuscation. 



**COMING SOON:**


*- Cellular Automata*


*- ML Training*


*- PRNG*


*- Probalistic Methods*

*Stateshaper* is strongest when used after other systems:


    ML → Stateshaper (freeze learned behavior)

    Markov → Stateshaper (lock a scenario)

    PRNG → Stateshaper (semanticize randomness)

    CA → Stateshaper (compress emergent states)



**HYBRID EXAMPLES ON THE WAY INCLUDE...**

*Fintech QA*

*MMORPG Worlds*

*Privacy-based Personalization*
